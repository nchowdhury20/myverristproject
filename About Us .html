<h2 style="text-align-last:center" >Our Mission</h2>

        <p>
            There's this notion that to grow a business, you have to be ruthless.
            But we know there's a better way to grow. One where what's good for
            the bottom line is also good for customers. We believe businesses can
            grow with a conscience, and succeed with a soul — and that they can do
            it with inbound. That's why we've created a platform uniting software,
            education, and community to help businesses grow better every day.

                <h2 style="text-align-last:center" >Our Story</h2>
                <p class="title"></p>
                <p> As fellow post graduate students at RGU in 2020, Samad and Bober
                    noticed a shift in the way people shop and buy. Consumers were
                    no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention —
                    in fact, they'd gotten really, really good at ignoring them.  </p>

                <p> From this shift, a company was born: HubSpot. It was founded on
                    "inbound", the notion that people don't want to be interrupted
                    by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.</p>
                    <p> Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses
                        around the world to stop interrupting, start helping,
                        and return their focus to the customer. </p>
